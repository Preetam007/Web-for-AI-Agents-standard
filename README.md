Programtic access to web3 and web2 apps for AI agents , connect with any website , naviate , to transaction 

Imagine deploying AI to index all web3 and web2 apps actions and expose them as a web API/ JSON. This scalable mapping of software interfaces would expose information and actions for ðŸ¤– to access.

Appleâ€™s latest event showcased a sophisticated approach to declarative automation for the agent layer with theÂ [**AppIntents API**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents). This framework offers app developers a declarative way to defineÂ *intents*Â that will be exposed to Siri and therefore Apple Intelligence. Instead of building tooling to reverse engineer the intents from app API or the code itself, giving app developers the ability to declareÂ *precisely*Â what they want to expose to Siri creates a super clean and powerful developer experience. Itâ€™s also much less headaches for Apple.
